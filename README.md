# Ruby Client

Ruby Client is a brand new Minecraft Launcher with many features that will help you, user, to manage all your Minecraft Vanilla/Forge/Quilt/Fabric versions easily, but it will also help server creators, by making what we call profile to automatically create an instance for the user with all the settings, mods, textures packs and so on to enter the server without doing all of this manually 😵‍💫.

## Nice 😄! But what are the features 🤔

In the user side, you can do a lot of things! In the default launcher, its hard to choose between what version you want or what mods you want for what version. In Ruby Client, you can create isolated Minecraft instance, which mean you share files with all your versions. This way, you can have an instance for Forge 1.12.2 with mods and have another version with other mods. Moreover, you can share your instance with friends or download instance made for servers.

Server creator, we didn't forget you, you are creating your own Minecraft server? Then you can create a Minecraft instance and share it with everyone using the Client! Choose the files to download, the settings to apply by default, and customize your home screen where users will launch their game in a unique way.

## How can I download that?

Just download it from the Releases tab in Github, select the newest version for better experience. Note that the Client is still in Alpha, some features may not be available yet and a lot of bugs can occured.

The client has a automatic update feature. When a new version is available, you will be notified in the client and invited to proceed, its easy and very important because they can fix a lot of issues.
